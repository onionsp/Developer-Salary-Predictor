## Description

ML Project that focused on end to end ML pipeline. Used the stackoverflow 2023 developer survey:https://survey.stackoverflow.co
Packaged the ML model into a streamlit app and deployed it on their community platform. 
Finished model classifies roughly within $30,000 of actual salary.

## Key Learnings
- Data cleaning on large dataset
- Dealing with outliers
- Importance of understanding data before rushing into models (Garbage in Garbage out)
- How to build + deploy streamlit apps. (found it was quite straightforward but ran into issues with hosting CSV file on github as too large)
## Further development plans
- Experiment with using different features to improve predictive accuracy of model
