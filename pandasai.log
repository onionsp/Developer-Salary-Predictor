### QUERY
 Give me a box plot of the totalComp by only the top 10 countries by data points per country

You generated this python code:
top_10_countries = dfs[0]['Country'].value_counts().nlargest(10).index.tolist()
top_10_countries_df = dfs[0][dfs[0]['Country'].isin(top_10_countries)]
plt.boxplot(top_10_countries_df['CompTotal'])
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Total Compensation')
plt.title('Box Plot of Total Compensation by Country')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
